                I am a Project Manager that provides GIS quality control and analysis for all GIS-centric projects -
                including Civil Engineering disciplines like Civil Design, Transportation, and Water Systems. I have
                designed a multitude of maps that demonstrate analysis and visualizations for these projects including
                sanitary and storm sewer networks that aid in the analysis of the overall network conditions.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                By developing models and python scripts to implement processes that contribute to quality assurance and
                quality control, I can help my team efficiently work through projects and create project deliverables.
                This includes continuous crosschecking of data collected by the TREKK field services during their
                investigations, as well as post-project data evaluations.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                I am highly experienced in the ESRI suite - including Storymaps and Experiences - to help clients track
                project progress, or view existing data collected by TREKK, through dashboards and web map applications.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                I am well versed in database organization, having more than 10 years experience in asset management
                software, and database management.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                I am an active developer on TREKKâ€™s Research and Development Team. Using my GIS knowledge, I can
                process, manage, and successfully execute multiple tasks for clients to develop easy to understand
                geographic representations of data. I proactively seeks out answers to problems; and see each task
                through with ingenuity and tenacity.

                midwest. The Corporate office is located in Kansas City, Missouri, I am currently employed in the St.
                Louis satellite office. Over the last five years, the St. Louis office has grown from 8 employees to 45
                employees. Working in a satellite office, I have had to wear many hats - administrative assistant, GIS
                Analyst, and Resource Leader.Now that we are larger, we can support a full time operations manager, so

                            running content maturity tools that assess the various dimensions of the data, i.e.
                            completeness or thematic accuracy. Harris could use these metrics in order to create our
                            source reports.

                            Research open source websites to fill the absent data of the clientâ€™s baseline. When Harris
                            deems a source as inaccurate, we like to have an open source alternative so that the client
                            is not losing data, but adding significant value to their current dataset.
