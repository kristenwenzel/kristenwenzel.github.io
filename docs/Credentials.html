                    Harris Corporation is known for their involvement with communications and information technology. The Geospatial Department works closely with NGA and is world renowned in digital data collection. I  had two major responsibilities while I worked at Harris, Content Assessment Lead and Geospatial Analyst. To learn more, read below.

                        <li>
                            As the project lead, my job is to fix road blocks my team may be facing in order to get their jobs completed. Whether it is data that needs to be downloaded, or clients that need to be contacted, I hold myself personally responsible to make sure my team members have smooth access to their data they are analyzing. 
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Advise team members who are writing reports – state of the data, areas to make data better, and what data to use. These reports utilize different ArcMap tools that compare old and new data to show client progress that our company has made on the data.   It also shows the client our team’s research abilities by bringing in other datasets to add value to the data. 
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Weekly\Bi-weekly conference calls or in-office meetings with clients to go over status and expectations.  We receive questions or guidance that I reiterate to my team members.
                            </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Preparation of presentations as well as actually presenting to clients to show what the company has been developing.

                        <li>
                            Approve\Decline project work, change directions (make sure team members in other departments are working towards the same goal).
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Create spreadsheets documenting hours spent on a project, team members who work on a project – all for planning purposes so that we do not get behind on a project or run out of work early. 
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Plan accordingly for all of the numerous contracts going on simultaneously. (Using spreadsheets) I currently am part of 9 contracts total with the client, each contract has many moving parts. Each contract can have up to 8 requirements. I am lead for 1-2 requirements in each of those 9 contracts.  
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Create SOP’s (review SOP’s) to make sure a new employee could read the procedure and understand how to complete a task. These SOP’s drive efficiency in a work environment by maintaining consistent work effort for a specific task, train team members on specific tasks (how to write reports, use Map tools, use JIRA, and evaluate metrics).

                            Created and maintained a system of organization for all source data coming in from NGA, as well as submissions of deliverables from subcontractors so that it was easy to identify what source Harris had accumulated, and what deliveries had been made from subcontractors.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Train co-workers how to create maps that assess the government’s current baseline data: running content maturity tools that assess the various dimensions of the data, i.e. completeness or thematic accuracy.  Harris could use these metrics in order to create our source reports. 
                            </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Research open source websites to fill the absent data of the client’s baseline. When Harris deems a source as inaccurate, we like to have an open source alternative so that the client is not losing data, but adding significant value to their current dataset.
